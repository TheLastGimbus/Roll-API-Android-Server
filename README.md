# Roll-API-Android-Server
Server for Roll API running on Android

This app functions as a HTTP server, that takes a request, shakes a physical dice using my shaking machine, takes a photo of dice, analyzes (using TF Lite) what is the number rolled on the dice, and sends back a JSON with link to photo of that dice and a number which it detected.

## What is Roll-API?
Roll-API is an API, (free and easy to use for everyone) that shakes a physical dice in a dice-shaking-machine that i've built, and sends you the number that was tossed.

### Sorry but it is not ready to use yet. I'm working on it!
